This project includes multiple MATLAB scripts that are interrelated. Here's how to use the main components:

**main.m:** The entry point for the project, performing the overarching analysis and calling other functions as needed.
**coordinateTransform.m, cubicSplines.m, Design_matrix.m, GenerateDesign_matrix.m:** Auxiliary scripts that support the main analysis, handling tasks like coordinate transformation and design matrix generation.
